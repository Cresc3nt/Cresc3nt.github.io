abstract = {Direct-to-cell satellites enable global network services for our regular phones/IoTs via 4G, 5G, and beyond. To enforce highly available, trustworthy, and roaming policy-compliant network services, they heavily rely on user geolocation and timing information from external global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to assist with their radio access, authentication, and authorization. Our analysis and field tests reveal that, this cross-technology over-reliance propagates satellite navigation's defects to direct-to-cell satellite networks, leading to diverse issues such as intermittent connectivity, over/under-billing, unauthorized services, and service denials even when direct-to-cell satellites are accessible. Our solution, SN2, adopts the "fate-sharing" principle to reuse direct-to-cell satellites themselves for self-navigating networks. By exploiting the flexible tradeoffs between satellite network availability and navigation accuracy, it enables "good enough" built-in navigation for highly available and functionally correct network services at a negligible cost of hardware or communication resources. Our evaluations with commodity satellite phones and 3GPP NTN protocol stacks demonstrate SN2's 4.4–23.5\texttimes{} network availability boost and 1.9–12.3\texttimes{} access latency reduction over legacy solutions.},

abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, such as Starlink, provide global internet access and currently serve content to millions of users. Recent work has shown that existing network infrastructures, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), are not well-suited to satellite network architectures. Traditional terrestrial CDNs degrade performance for satellite network users and do not alleviate the congestion in the ground-satellite links. We design StarCDN, a new CDN architecture that caches content in space to improve user experience and reduce ground-satellite bandwidth usage. The fundamental challenge in designing StarCDN lies in the orbital motion of satellites, which causes each satellite's coverage area to change rapidly, serving vastly different regions (e.g., US and Europe) within minutes. To address this, we introduce new consistent hashing and relayed fetching schemes tailored to LEO satellite networks. Our design enables cached content to flow in the opposite direction of the orbital motion to counter satellite motion. We evaluate StarCDN against multiple baselines using real-world traces from Akamai. Our evaluation demonstrates that StarCDN can reduce the ground-to-satellite bandwidth utilization by 80\% and improve user-perceived latency by 2.5X. Further, we make available an open-source trace generator, SpaceGEN, for realistic simulations of satellite-based CDNs.},

abstract = {This paper explores traffic engineering (TE) for large-scale Low-Earth-Orbit satellite constellations. While there is rich prior work on TE algorithms for global cloud wide-area networks (WANs), they are designed for static network topologies and often require significant computation time for large-scale networks. Such limitations make existing WAN TE algorithms unsuitable for large-scale satellite networks which rapidly change topology and require computing optimal traffic allocation under stringent latency constraints.We present SaTE, a low-latency TE algorithm for large-scale satellite networks, computing traffic allocation at millisecond latency. SaTE formulates a heterogeneous graph to model the TE problem, adapting to dynamic satellite topologies. By removing redundant graph relations, SaTE reduces computational latency, allowing the graph to be efficiently learned by a graph neural network that leverages GPUs to rapidly infer traffic allocations. SaTE also exploits the similarity of satellite network topologies and the geospatial distribution of traffic demands to facilitate model training. We evaluate SaTE through extensive data-driven simulation on today's largest satellite constellation, Starlink with 4236 satellites. Our results show over a 23.5\% improvement in satisfied demand with an average TE runtime of 17 ms, achieving a 2738\texttimes{} speedup compared to commercial solvers.},

abstract = {Do we really need 10,000s of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to meet huge global Internet demands? While proven feasible and valuable, such LEO mega-constellation networks have raised concerns about their prohibitive capital expenditures, market monopoly, and unsustainable use of space. Instead, our analysis reveals that most of their satellites can be wasted due to their mismatch with physically uneven demands. We thus propose TinyLEO, a software-defined solution to shrink LEO network size for enormous global demands via dynamic spatiotemporal supply-demand matching. TinyLEO sparsifies satellite supplies on demand by combining diverse yet sparse orbits, hides complexities of this sparse LEO network via orbital model predictive control, and shifts the responsibility for handling these complexities to its geographic segment anycast for higher network usability, lower resource wastes, faster failovers, simpler satellites, and more flexible network orchestration. We have prototyped TinyLEO as a community toolkit for open research. Our evaluation using this toolkit shows that TinyLEO can compress the existing LEO mega-constellation network size by 2.0–7.9\texttimes{}, cut control plane costs by 1–3 orders of magnitude, and maintain the same demands and comparable data plane performance.},
