abstract = {Direct-to-cell satellites enable global network services for our regular phones/IoTs via 4G, 5G, and beyond. To enforce highly available, trustworthy, and roaming policy-compliant network services, they heavily rely on user geolocation and timing information from external global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to assist with their radio access, authentication, and authorization. Our analysis and field tests reveal that, this cross-technology over-reliance propagates satellite navigation's defects to direct-to-cell satellite networks, leading to diverse issues such as intermittent connectivity, over/under-billing, unauthorized services, and service denials even when direct-to-cell satellites are accessible. Our solution, SN2, adopts the "fate-sharing" principle to reuse direct-to-cell satellites themselves for self-navigating networks. By exploiting the flexible tradeoffs between satellite network availability and navigation accuracy, it enables "good enough" built-in navigation for highly available and functionally correct network services at a negligible cost of hardware or communication resources. Our evaluations with commodity satellite phones and 3GPP NTN protocol stacks demonstrate SN2's 4.4–23.5\texttimes{} network availability boost and 1.9–12.3\texttimes{} access latency reduction over legacy solutions.},
