title = "Hummingbird: Energy efficient GPS receiver for small satellites",
abstract = "Global Positioning System is a widely adopted localization technique. With the increasing demand for small satellites, the need for a low-power GPS for satellites is also increasing. To enable many state-of-the-art applications, the exact position of the satellites is necessary. However, building low-power GPS receivers which operate in low earth orbit pose significant challenges. This is mainly due to the high speed (∼7.8 km/s) of small satellites. While duty-cycling the receiver is a possible solution, the high relative Doppler shift between the GPS satellites and the small satellite contributes to the increase in Time To First Fix (TTFF), thus increasing the energy consumption. Further, if the GPS receiver is tumbling along with the small satellite on which it is mounted, longer TTFF may lead to no GPS fix due to disorientation of the receiver antenna. In this paper, we elucidate the design of a low-cost, low-power GPS receiver for small satellite applications. We also propose an energy optimization algorithm called F3to improve the TTFF which is the main contributor to the energy consumption during cold start. With simulations and in-orbit evaluation from a launched nanosatellite with our μGPS and high-end GPS simulators, we show that up to 96.16% of energy savings (consuming only ∼ 1/25th energy compared to the state of the art) can be achieved using our algorithm without compromising much (∼10 m) on the navigation accuracy. The TTFF achieved is at most 33 s.",

abstract = {The first low earth orbit satellite networks for internet service have recently been deployed and are growing in size, yet will face deployment challenges in many practical circumstances of interest. This paper explores how a dual-band, electronically tunable smart surface can enable dynamic beam alignment between the satellite and mobile users, make service possible in urban canyons, and improve service in rural areas. Our design is the first of its kind to target dual channels in the Ku radio frequency band with a novel dual Huygens resonator design that leverages radio reciprocity to allow our surface to simultaneously steer energy in the satellite uplink and downlink directions, and in both reflective and transmissive modes of operation. Our surface, Wall-E, is designed and evaluated in an electromagnetic simulator and demonstrates 94\% transmission efficiency and a 85\% reflection efficiency, with at most 6 dB power loss at steering angles over a 150 degree field of view for both transmission and reflection. With 75cm2 surface, our link budget calculations predict 4 dB and 24 dB improvement in the SNR of a link entering the window of a rural home in comparison to the free-space path and brick wall penetration, respectively.},

abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is essential for wireless communication. While manufacturing and launching LEO satellites have become efficient and cost-effective, ground stations remain expensive due to complex designs for handling severe path losses and precise beam tracking. Hence, it is important to develop low cost and high-performance ground stations for widespread adoption of LEO satellite communication. Towards realizing this goal, we design a passive metasurface-enhanced LEO ground station system, named PMSat, combining metasurface's fine-grained beamforming capability with a small-size phased array's adaptive steering and focusing. For uplink, we jointly optimize the phase array codebook and uplink metasurface phase profile, and realize electronic steering by switching the codeword. We further jointly optimize the downlink metasurface phase profile to improve the focusing performance and enhance the received signal strength (RSS) over a wide range of incident angles. Our PMSat prototype consists of a single passive metasurface with 21 \texttimes{} 21 elements for uplink and 22 \texttimes{} 22 for downlink, along with 1 \texttimes{} 4 receiving and 1 \texttimes{} 4 transmitting phased array antennas. The effectiveness of our proposed PMSat is validated through extensive experiments, and results demonstrate that the optimized metasurface improves the SNR by 8.32 dB and 16.57 dB for uplink and downlink, respectively.},

abstract = {Cheap spaceflight has ushered in an explosive growth era for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. While this has brought us LEO satellite megaconstellations for ubiquitious highspeed data, it has also enabled a proliferation of nanosatellites (e.g. CubeSats) launched by diverse organizations. An unfortunate side-effect is harmful interference to sensitive receivers like those of radio astronomy --- no place on Earth is safe. How can we enjoy the fruits of the satellite revolution without blinding ourselves to the secrets of the universe?Networking is the key. This paper proposes InOrbitNet, which aggregates and backhauls traffic from low-capability nanosatellites using highly-capable LEO megaconstellations. By simulating LEO and nanosatellite orbit transitions, we show that orders-of-magnitude reductions in latency and significant increases in capacity are possible as compared to the current non-networked direct-to-ground approach. But more importantly, because LEO megaconstellations are highly capable and tightly managed, this consolidation of RF footprints also allows radio astronomy to be protected from interference.},
